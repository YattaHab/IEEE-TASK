                Awesome teaching support from
                TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.

                *The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. "
